## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As part of Project 1 under the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, I was tasked to select a dataset, select a few questions of interest and answer them according to the CRISP-DM process.

I decided on the Seattle Airbnb dataset as I have always loved using Airbnb for my travel overseas and I thought this would be a good starting point for my data science portfolio. With the Seattle Airbnb dataset, I aimed to answer the following questions:

1. Which is the busiest month of the year for Airbnbs in Seattle?
2. How much do prices increase for the busiest months in the year for Airbnbs in Seattle?
3. Does the popularity (availability) of Airbnb homes correlate to their review score?
4. Does the popularity (availability) of Airbnb homes correlate to their price?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is just 1 Jupyter notebook that showcases my work done using the Seattle Airbnb dataset to answer the questions set out in the previous section. Comments and markdown cells were used to explain the steps carried out and my thought process.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@misc.wayne123/which-time-of-the-year-should-you-visit-seattle-ed0f1db9b280).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
